How to build the Windows client installers on unix-based systems
----------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to get a working cross compile area set up.

Go to http://burp.grke.net/ and follow the links to download:
burp-cross-tools-(latest.version).tar.bz2

Unpack the archive in the same top-level directory in which you downloaded
the burp sources, and go into the directory called 'source'.
You should have the burp source directory and the burp-cross-tools directory
at the same level.
Follow the instructions in the README files.
This will install cross compilers for both 32bit and 64bit clients.


Then you need to build the burp dependencies.

Go to http://burp.grke.net/ and follow the links to download:
burp-depkgs-(latest.version).tar.bz2

Unpack them in the same top-level directory in which you downloaded
the burp sources, and go into the directory called 'source'.
You should have the burp source directory and the burp-depkgs directory
at the same level.
Follow the instructions in the README files.
This will install the dependencies for both 32bit and 64bit clients.

Once these have been built successfully, you can build the burp installers
themselves.

Change to the burp source directory.

Standing in src/win32, run the following:

  make            (for 32bit clients)
  make WIN64=yes  (for 64bit clients)

All being well, the installer file will appear in:

  release32       (for 32bit clients)
  release64       (for 64bit clients)
