Things to watch out for when upgrading.

2.2.12
------
The command line option to print the version number, is now '-V'.
It has made way for the new '-v' option, which means 'log to stdout'.

2.2.10
------
The server side options 'address', 'port', 'status_address', and 'status_port'
have been removed. They have been replaced with 'listen' and 'listen_status'.

2.0.42
------
A bug in generating protocol 2 rabin checksums was fixed. Any protocol 2
backups made up to this point should be discarded.

2.0.32
------
'make install' will now install everything except configuration files.
'make install-config' will install configuration files, and will overwrite
without warning.
'make install-all' will install everything.

2.0.30
------
The configure system has been rewritten and vastly improved. One difference
to watch out for is that 'make install' will now overwrite any existing burp
config files and scripts without any warning.

2.0.26
------
The dhfile generation command in burp_ca has changed from 'openssl dhparam -out
"$dhfile" 1024' to 'openssl dhparam -dsaparam -out "$dhfile" 2048' in order
to make ssl key exchange more secure.
Your existing /etc/burp/dhfile.pem on your burp server will not be regenerated
unless you delete /etc/burp/dhfile.pem by hand (rm -f /etc/burp/dhfile.pem)
and restart the burp server.

2.0.22
------
The protocol2 manifest formats have changed. You should therefore not mix
earlier 2.0.x servers and clients with this version, and protocol2 backups from
earlier versions will no longer work.

2.0.20
------
The option 'working_dir_recovery_method = use' has been removed.

2.0.12
------
Executable scripts that used to be in /etc/burp are now installed in
/usr/share/burp/scripts: notify_script, ssl_extra_checks_script,
summary_script, and timer_script.
On upgrading, you should probably fix the paths to these scripts in
/etc/burp/burp-server.conf.
Package building files have not yet been updated to reflect this change.
Patches gratefully accepted.

2.0.10
------
The status monitor system and ncurses client are now working to some degree.
You now need to use a burp client to connect to the status port via SSL.
This also means that you may use the ncurses client on a machine that is not
the burp server.
You can use 'burp -a m' to get a raw connection (useful for debugging or to
see the JSON), or 'burp -a s' to use the ncurses client.
You will not be able to see details of any clients unless you are connecting
from the client in question, or you are a restore_client (see the man page
for this option).
On upgrading from previous versions of burp, you will not have some of the
necessary config values for connecting to the status port.
Both server and client will need 'status_port = 4972'.
The client will need 'server = <server address>'.
The server address may need to be '::1' if you are connecting locally. You may
use 'netstat -plant | grep burp' to determine the address that burp is
listening on.
There are still some pieces in the ncurses client that are not fully
implemented.
More details about all this will be in documentation to be written soon.

2.0.9
-----
The configuration file parser now understands single quotes and double quotes
properly. If you have single quotes or double quotes around your config value,
the parser will now treat backslash as the escaping character. If you do not
have quotes around your config value, the config value will be taken literally.

2.0.7
-----
The bedup program is now contained within the burp binary. 'make install' will
create a 'bedup' symlink to the burp binary. Executing 'bedup' will then work
as before.

2.0.6
-----
Warning about hardlinked_archive in protocol1 style backups:
In this version, I have changed the way that hardlinked_archive works slightly,
in order to fix https://github.com/grke/burp/issues/176 - unnecessary
duplication and deletion.
In the past, the previous current backup would have a file called 'hardlinked'
created when the next backup was being finalised. So, the decision was being
made during the next backup.
Now, the decision is being made for each backup when it is being finalised
itself (rather than waiting for the next one).
This means that, when you upgrade, your most recent backup will look like a
non-hardlinked_archive, and when you make you next protocol1 style backup with a
2.0.x server, it will treat the previous backup as a non-hardlinked_archive.
If you need it to be a hardlinked_archive, make sure that you anticipate this
before the next backup happens, by creating a file called something like:
/var/spool/burp/<client>/current/hardlinked

2.0.4
-----
There has been a massive rewrite of most of burp.

The intention is that burp1 clients will continue to work with burp2
servers.
Burp2 clients can also be configured to work in burp1 mode. See the 'protocol'
option in the man page and example config files.
Burp2 code is capable of doing variable length chunking for inline
deduplication, with sparse indexing on the server side.

Use this version with extreme caution.
Burp2 is currently missing some features, such as acl/xattr, Windows EFS,
encryption and compression support.
The burp1 protocol should still work with these features, but be careful.
The status monitor is also not working. 
Due to the extent of the rewrite, pretty much anything may not working
correctly.
Do not expect burp2, and the backups that it makes, to be compatible
with future releases of burp2.

1.3.24
------
If installing with 'make install' and you want to use the
server_script_pre/post_notify feature, then you will probably need to overwrite
/etc/burp/notify_script by hand. The arguments to it have not changed though,
so if you do not want to use that feature, you do not need to do this.

1.3.18
------
Special care is advised when testing this release, as some of the main
structure of the program has been tweaked in order to support the stripping
out of Windows VSS information.

1.3.16
------
If you have any clients on 1.3.14, you should upgrade them to 1.3.14 due to
a bug in the exclude_comp feature.

1.3.14
------
If installing with 'make install', you will probably need to overwrite
/etc/burp/notify_script by hand.
The arguments to it have changed, so you will also need to update the
configuration in /etc/burp/burp-server.conf to be in the new style. The example
config in configs/server/burp.conf will help. 

The '-l <path>' and 'logfile = <path>' options have been removed because they
didn't work properly, and there was no sensible way to make the work properly.
There are now three settings in the conf files: stdout=[0|1], syslog=[0|1],
and progress_counters=[0|1]. If you want to see output, you may need to set
these options.

1.3.3
-----
If installing with 'make install' and you want to use the 'initialise manual
backup from server' feature, you will need to replace /etc/burp/timer_script
with configs/server/timer_script from the source, because 'make install' will
not overwrite the old version.

1.3.2
-----
The process of generating SSL certificates has been automated, so the old
default keys and certificates have been removed from new installs.
See docs/burp_ca.txt for more information.

1.3.1
-----
Due to Debian policy, burp and bedup will now be installed in /usr/sbin.
Therefore, you may need to update any cron jobs that were previously using
/sbin.

1.2.4
-----
There was a critical bug in 1.2.4.
Please upgrade clients and servers to 1.2.5 as soon as you can.

1.1.x to 1.2.0
---------------
* Clients on 1.1.70 or older will not work with a 1.2.0 server. You will need
to upgrade the clients at the same time. Your old backups will continue to
work.
* If you previously compiled with './configure --prefix=/usr', you will probably
now want to compile with just './configure'. The binary will now go to
/sbin/burp, with a symlink from /usr/sbin/burp.
* If you are installing from source onto the server, you may want to
'rm /etc/burp/notify_script' before 'make installation', otherwise you won't
get the updated version.
