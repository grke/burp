Backup verification script
--------------------------

backup_tool_script is a script to check backup sanity

backup_tool_script can verify a given number of backups for each client. It can run verifiy operations in parallel, interleaving different clients in order to prevent performance bottlenecks on backend storage.
Verify operations are timed in order to stop them after a given amount of time, leaving the system performance ready for backup operations.
The script can also list clients that have outdated backups. It uses two different methods to list clients in order to detect rogue clients.
It can also ensure that the server service is running properly, relaunch it if needed, on a scheduled basis.
It can list all last backups containing warning messages as a summary.
The script can send a warning / error when problems are found, even while operating.
The script can also check disk quotas and send a warning when quotas are exceeded.
backup_tool_script can also launch vss_strip for each file found in a given directory.

Usage
-----

You will find the script in /usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script

To begin with, modify the script and configure the following variables:

INSTANCE_ID: Some unique string to identify the instance of the script, given that you may run multiple versions with different settings
MAIL_ALERT_MSG: The warning / error email subject
SOFT_MAX_EXEC_TIME_PER_VERIFY: Amount of time for each verification process (in seconds) after which a warning message is sent to inform that the single verification process takes too long
HARD_MAX_EXEC_TIME_PER_VERIFY: Amount of time for each verification process (in seconds) after which the verification process is forcefully stopped
SOFT_MAX_EXEC_TIME: Amount of global time (in seconds) after which a warning message is sent to inform that the verification processes takes too long
HARD_MAX_EXEC_TIME: Amount of global time (in seconds) after which all verification operations are forcefully stopped
POSTPONE: If client isn't idle, should we postpone it's verification (YES/NO)
POSTPONE_TIME: Amount of time (in seconds) after which a postponed verification is tried again
POSTPONE_RETRY: Number of times a postponed verification is retried
BACKUP_EXECUTABLE: Name of the burp executable, don't change it until you have reasons to
SERVICE_TYPE: Which service system your are using. Can be set to "initv" or "systemd"
PARALLEL_VERIFY_CONCURRENCY: How many simultaneous verify operations will be launched

After having setup those initial values, you may test backup_tool_script with your current setup

Syntax
------

The path given to backup_tool_script must be the path that leads to every client directory, regardless of protocol 1 or 2 usage (for protocol 2, you'll have to dive into dedup group directory).

Check for clients that don't have backups newer than 3 days
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backups/dir -o 3

Launch backup verification for last 7 backups for each client
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backups/dir -v 7

Run with a different client configuration file (default is /etc/burp/burp.conf) and check for clients that don't have backups newer than 5 days
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -c /etc/burp/burp-client.conf -d /path/to/clients/backup/dir -o 5

Run vss_strip for all files in /tmp/burp_restore
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -s /tmp/burp_restore

Check that burp service is running
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -j burp

Check for warnings in last backups
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backups/dir -w

Check for exceeded quotas in last backups
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backups/dir -q

Example of full configuration, which checks the service health, checks for outdated clients, verifies last 5 backups, checks for warning in last backups, and sends a report to an email address specifying a trivial instance name 
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backup/dir -o 3 -v 5 -j burp -c /etc/burp/burp.conf -w --destination-mails=backupadmin@example.com --instance-id=burp_checks

You can check the full syntax simply by running the script without any arguments.

Client inclusions and exclusions
--------------------------------

You may want to include / exclude some clients on the checks.
backup_tool_script uses grep compatible regular expressions to do so. Inclusions are evaluated before exclusions.

Exmaple: include all clients which names begin with "servers", and exclude everything else:
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -i servers.* -e ".*" -d /path/to/clients/backup/dir

Example: exclude all clients which names begin with customerX:
/usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -e customerX.* -d /path/to/clients/backup/dir

Scheduling
----------

Once you have found the right settings for your usage, you may schedule the script by adding a cron entry.
Example on RHEL / CentOS, add the following line to /etc/crontab in order to run the script every day at 10am.

00 10 * * * root /usr/local/share/burp/scripts/backup_tool_script -d /path/to/clients/backup/dir -o 3 -v 5 -j burp -c /etc/burp/burp.conf -w --destination-mails=backupadmin@example.com --instance-id=burp_checks

On Ubuntu, you'll need to remove the "root" username on the crontab line.

Scheduling considerations
-------------------------

The tool can detect that a backup is currently running and will postpone verifications, but considering that backups may occur nightly depending on your configuration,
it would make more sense to run verifications out of the backup timeframe.
Be aware that running the verifications while performing backups, backup numbers may change, so verifications may fail.
This is especially true when trying to check more backups than the actual retention policy.

Example: keeping 7 daily backups with 'keep 7'
If you launch backup_tool_script with -v 7, if the verification happens while backing up, the 7th backup may be deleted after successful creation of the new up to date backup,
and backup_tool_script will fail verifying the 7th backup it listed on script start.
In order to avoid this, verify the last 6 backups when having 7 rotating copies, or simply let backup_tool_script run only when no backups are currently running.

Client emails
-------------

You may want to send an email directly to a client whenever no recent backups are found or disk quotas exceed.
In this case, you have to add an email address to the client configuration file.

Exmaple client in /etc/burp/clientconfdir/test.local

include /some/path
label = email_address : some@example.com

With this additional information, the script can send an email directly to the client address.
In order to send an alert on exceeded quota, add the '-A' parameter or '--client-alert-quotas'
In order to send an alert on outdated backups, add the '-a' parameter or '--client-alert-outdated'

Additionnaly, you may want to customize the messages sent. Please see the configuration header in the file in order to customize the emails.
You may use placeholders for clientname, disk quotas statistics and outdated clients.

Logs
----

By default, backup_tool_script logs to /var/log/backup_tool_script.[instance-id].log
If /var/log is not writable, it will log to ${HOME}.

Customisation and developpment
------------------------------

As of today, the script should work on all linux platforms.
Some work is needed to make some regular expressions work on *BSD.
Feel free to fork and help :)
