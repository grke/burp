Burp is open and free software. I work on it in my spare time. If you would
like this work to continue, please consider making a small donation. A
PayPal donation button can be found on the website http://burp.grke.net/, along
with a bitcoin address.

If you want to donate but don't like PayPal bitcoins, please email me via the
website contact page and we can talk about alternatives.
