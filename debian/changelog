burp (1.3.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release version 1.3.26
    -  When a read_blockdev option matches a symlink, backup the destination as
    a raw block device.
    - Avi Rozen's valgrind cleanup. Includes a fix for a bug in restore_client.c
    where overwrite_ok checked the wrong stat struct when considering a FIFO.
    - Add '-v' option to bedup (output the names of duplicate files).
    - Add '-d' option to bedup (delete duplicates instead of hardlinking - not
    for use on burp storage directories).

      modified.

      signals, such as Ctrl-C.

      quite working properly, but it may still be useful.
    - Big fix to stop Windows going to sleep during a backup, from Avi Rozen.

burp (1.3.22-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
  * New upstream release version 1.3.22

	+ Bug fix for list/verify/restore when regex is long and/or contains
	  a colon.
	+ Bug fix for split_vss backups being restored on a linux

	+ Bug fix for the size option.
	+ Use shell numeric comparison instead of string comparison.

    - Fix segfault that was happening on the server when SSL_accept() failed.
