.SH NAME
bedup \- deduplication program with additional knowledge of @name@

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bedup
.RI [ options ]
.br

.LP
A file deduplication program with additional knowledge of @name@ storage directories. This program comes with the @name@ backup and restore package.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fBpath\fR
Path to config file (default: /etc/@name@/@name@.conf).
.TP
\fB\-g\fR \fB<list of group names>\fR
Only run on the directories of clients that are in one of the groups specified. The list is comma-separated. To put a client in a group, use the 'dedup_group' option in the client configuration file on the server.
.TP
\fB\-h|-?\fR \fB\fR
Print help text and exit.
.TP
\fB\-d \fR \fB\fR
Delete any duplicate files found. (non-@name@ mode only, use with caution!)
.TP
\fB\-l \fR \fB\fR
Hard link any duplicate files found.
.TP
\fB\-m \fR \fB<number>\fR
Maximum number of hard links to a single file. (non-@name@ mode only - in @name@ mode, use the max_hardlinks option in the configuration file) The default is 10000. On ext3, the maximum number of links possible is 32000, but space is needed for the normal operation of @name@.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fB<list of directories>\fR
Non-@name@ mode. Deduplicate any (set of) directories.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\fR
Print duplicate paths. Useful if you want to double check the files that would be hard linked or deleted before running with one of those options turned on.\fR
.TP
\fB\-V\fR \fB\fR
Print version and exit.\fR
.TP
By default, bedup will read /etc/@name@/@name@.conf and deduplicate client storage directories using special knowledge of the structure.\fR
.TP
With '\-n', this knowledge is turned off and you have to specify the directories to deduplicate on the command line. Running with '\-n' is therefore dangerous if you are deduplicating @name@ storage directories.
