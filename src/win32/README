How to build the Windows client installers on unix-based systems
----------------------------------------------------------------

First you need to get a working cross compile area set up.
See https://github.com/grke/burp-cross-tools

This will install cross compilers for both 32bit and 64bit clients
and all the burp dependencies, inside a docker image.

You can now start the docker image, copy the burp sources inside, and
build the burp installers themselves.

Change to the burp source directory.

Standing in src/win32, run the following:

  make            (for 32bit clients)
  make WIN64=yes  (for 64bit clients)

All being well, the installer file will appear in:

  release32       (for 32bit clients)
  release64       (for 64bit clients)
