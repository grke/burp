Run the script 'test_self'.

It will copy the source from the parent directory into 'build', and then
install it into 'target'.

It will then run through some basic tests, running the server and client on
the same machine.


WINDOWS

To run an automatic test of Windows, you need to set up cygwin on your Windows
machine. It needs to include openssh-server.
The user that you ssh in as needs to have administrator privileges.
An annoying feature/bug is that using ssh keys to log in without a password
means that you don't actually get full privileges.
This means that the test script needs to be given the password, which it
uses in an 'expect' script to run commands on the Windows machine.
This means that the password will appear on the Linux machine in 'ps' type
lists. So, be mindful. This is acceptable for me, because my Windows machine
exists solely to run burp tests and I don't use the password for it anywhere
else.

You need to get the clock on the Windows machine to be close to the clock
on the server, otherwise you will have certificate problems.
