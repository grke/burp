    - Many code improvements and bug fixes.
  * This release was focused on making the burp protocol 1 support good.
    Be sure to read the UPGRADING file. Protocol 2 is still work in progress,
    so do not expect protocol 2 backups to work with future releases.

    attempting to rename anything to it.

2013-10-30 Changes in burp-1.3.40:

    quite working properly, but it may still be useful.
  * Bug fix to stop Windows going to sleep during a backup, from Avi Rozen.

2013-01-02 Changes in burp-1.3.22:

  * Do not skip restores of sockets.
  * Add server_can_restore=[0|1] client side option, so that clients can refuse
    server initiated restores.

    installer.
  * Indicate to the server post script whether there was an error.

    the start menu.
  * Allow the Windows installer options to be set on the Windows command line.
  * Add password_check=[0|1] to options on the server. Defaults to on. Turning
    it off disables client password checks (although SSL certificates are still

    the potential to corrupt backups.
  * Force directory_tree = 0 for clients on less than version 1.3.6.
  * Escape '-' symbols in man pages.
  * Save received certs as temporary files and then rename them, to avoid
    accidently truncating the current ones.
  * If Windows VSS snapshot fails, do not continue.
  * 32bit mingw64 has difficulty printf-ing multiple %llu items and sometimes
    even segfaults, so split the counters into individual printfs.

2012-05-28 Changes in burp-1.3.6:
  * Store files in a directory structure like that of the original client.
  * Fix 'ERROR: Please use absolute include/exclude paths' when setting paths

  * Unhide warning messages originally hidden by bacula when having errors
    when setting things like file times.
  * Fix bug where file times were not getting set on Windows directories.
  * Remove openssl "can't open config file" warning when generating
    certificates on Windows.
  * Set IPTOS_THROUGHPUT bulk packet flag for linux backups. Windows/mingw64
    appears not to be able to do this.

2012-04-27 Changes in burp-1.3.4:
  * Bug fix for Windows backups where it had stopped using the Windows backup
    API in 1.3.2.
  * Automatically convert backslashes to forward slashes for includes/excludes
    on Windows clients.
  * Bug fix: pass the path to the CA conf file whenever running burp_ca (fixes
    problems with the test scripts).
  * Remove whitespace that was causing the burp_ca '--crl' option not to work.
  * Have separate CA directories for the client and server. Make 'make install'
    create the directory /etc/burp/CA-client.
  * Make compile succeed when there is no libncurses library.
  * Add 'client_can_force_backup' option, defaulted to on. Turning it off means
    that only timed backups are allowed. Also add similar 'client_can_list',
    'client_can_restore' and 'client_can_verify' options.
  * Remove getopt from burp_ca, allowing it to work on Macs.
  * Make an unknown exclude_fs a non-fatal error.
  * Add ability to trigger a backup on the server side by placing a file called
    'backup' in the client's storage directory.
  * Fix bug where block device nodes were not backed up. Add 'read_blockdev'
    and 'read_all_blockdevs' options that work the same as the equivalent
    fifo options.
  * Add 'notify_success_changes_only' option, which means that success
    notifications only get sent if there were new or changed files.
  * Added Ruben Kerkhof's fixes to make run_script() work on OSX.
  * For each file, store the compression setting in the manifest.
  * Stop clients connecting twice when a timed backup is rejected.

2012-03-31 Changes in burp-1.3.2:
  * Add options for the client to automatically generate a certificate signing
    request, have the server sign and return it, and have the client use the
    new certificate. Remove old default SSL certificates because they should
    no longer be needed.
    See docs/burp_ca.txt for more information.
  * Add ability for conf files to point to more conf files to read.
  * Fix status server segfault when deleting files from clientconfdir.
  * Allow directories in clientconfdir.
  * Add the ability for the server to set the client include/excludes.
  * Simulate browsing backups with the use of "-a l/L -d path".
  * Add ability to set up a restore on the server side.
  * Add ability to specify child processes separately to status child process
    with new max_status_children option.
  * Status monitor - make keypresses more responsive.
  * Fix bug where old clients that didn't leave an incexc file on the server
    meant that resume would not start.
  * Add 'include_ext' option, which excludes all files unless their names end
    in the given extension.
  * Fall back to using the client or server name if ssl_peer_cn is unset on the
    server or client.
  * Don't try to chuser/chgrp in the child if the user/group settings are the
    same as the parent (fixes bug where setting user/group in the server
    wouldn't work, because it would try to chuser/chgrp twice).
  * Windows installer: add comment about poll interval '0' means that the
    scheduled job isn't installed.
  * Windows installer: don't install the scheduled task when doing an upgrade.
  * Unlock the client directory after server_script_post has run instead of
    before.
  * Fix bug where the wrong arg count was being given to the server post
    script.
  * Make sure status snapshot exits when there are no backup clients.
  * Ability to dump logs and paths in backups using '-a S' (useful for making
    a gui that browses backup contents).
  * Bug fixes to ssl_extra_checks_script.
  * Bug fix: initialise network_timeout properly.
  * Fix typos in docs/burp_ca.txt.
  * Add 'LANG=C' to the timer script, so that timer_arg days are always
    expected in English.
  * Add config file option to turn syslog logging on/off.
  * Bug fix for 'compression = gzip[0-9]'.
  * Pass the server version to the client.

2012-02-27 Changes in burp-1.3.1:
  * EFS support on Windows.
  * Move to using mingw-w64 for both 32bit and 64bit Windows builds.
  * Add 'exclude_fs =' option for Linux so that you can skip partitions
    types (for example, tmpfs) without generating warnings.
  * If recovery method 'resume' is set, but the includes/excludes change,
    switch to 'use', then start a new backup.
  * In the tests, check to see whether it looks like the server has finished
    the backup before moving on, rather than just waiting a set amount of time.
  * Add man pages for bedup and burp_ca.
  * Remove embedded uthash code. It will need to be installed as a dependency.
    For example, in Debian, you might run 'apt-get install uthash-dev'.
  * Add Bas van den Dikkenberg's tweaks for getting burp into official Debian
    and Ubuntu repositories. Burp is now in debian sid and ubuntu precise.
  * Make the server tell the client what extra_comms features it supports, so
    that, in future, old servers are more likely to work with new clients.
  * Improve 'make clean'.
  * Add option to strip off leading path components on restore.
  * Fix segfault that was happening on the server when SSL_accept() failed.
  * Move burp and bedup to /usr/sbin (you need to check that any cron jobs
    are pointing there too).

  * Fix rounding problem in remaining time estimation in the status monitor.
  * Don't backup the whole file if only ctime changed.

  * Do not log a message in the server SIGCHLD handler, as this appeared to
    be causing an occasional lock up on a Ubuntu server.
  * Upgrade Windows depkgs to latest versions of openssl.
  * Make Windows uninstall work.
  * Add 'allow autoupgrade' option to a second screen on the Windows installer.
  * Add 'max_storage_subdirs' option, and default it to 30000.

  * Add an automated test script.
  * Fix bugs with uncompressed encrypted backup/restore.
  * Get verify all backups for a client (-a v -b a) to work.
  * Return non-zero if there were warnings on verify or restore.
  * Add 'min_file_size' option, fix 'max_file_size' option.
  * Add generic server-side pre/post scripts that can run on every connection
    after authentication and before disconnecting.
  * Set environment variables from SSL cert details so that the server-side
    scripts can see them.
  * Add Jason Haar's server script for doing extra SSL certificate checks.
  * Add 'max_hardlinks' option, which limits the number of times a single file
    is hardlinked in storage. Default is 10000.
  * Add '-i' option: print an index table of symbols that humans may see burp
    produce, and exit.
  * Let backups carry on when files cannot be opened.
  * Spot Windows EFS directories and files and warn about them.
  * Add an 'estimate' option (-a e), which does a scan of the file system to
    be backed up, and prints counters, without contacting the server.
  * Strip out 744 lines of unused Windows code.
  * Fix possible segfault when backup directory forward paths don't match.
  * Removed working_dir_recovery_method=merge. Use 'resume' instead.
  * Add a flexible way of passing new fields from the client to the server so
    that clients are less likely to have to upgrade.

2011-11-26 Changes in burp-1.2.5:
  * IMPORTANT: Fixed critical path comparison typo bug. If you have been using
	1.2.4 either as a server or as a client, you need to upgrade
	immediately! Backups made with 1.2.4 should be treated as suspicious.
  * Add a 'max_file_size' option.
  * Store windows file attributes in a separate field to the standard unix ones.

2011-11-22 Changes in burp-1.2.4:

  * Multiple retention periods (e.g, keep 1 backup per day for 7 days, 1
    backup per week for 4 weeks, 1 backup per 4 weeks for a year). See the
    'keep' option in the man page.
  * Make sure the client version warning message appears in the backup log.
  * Network send rate-limiting feature (both client and server).
  * Change pidfile paths to /var/run/burp instead of /var/lock/burp.
  * Get pre backup scripts running reliably again. Also, send script messages
    on stderr to the server backup log.
  * Fix 'Warnings' line on the status monitor.
  * Fix resume mode bug to do with potentially partially written entries at
    the end of the phase2 file.

2011-09-09 Changes in burp-1.2.0:
  * Improvements to the counters and status monitor - remember the phase1
    scan counters for later phases to use for things like estimated times.

    backup from the point it was interrupted.
  * Add a useful message about options when run with '-h' or '-?'.
  * Get the client to pass its version to the server. The minimum version the
    client needs to be is now this release.
  * Get the server to warn when the client is on a different version.
  * Put the number of warnings in the subject of the notification emails.

  * Small bug fixes to the status monitor.
  * Fixed working directory recovery bug where it couldn't find the manifest.gz
    file due to it being called manifest.gz.tmp.

    inherited from bacula. Just call all the functions directly.
  * Fix compiler warnings and '-ldl' linker error on FreeBSD 8.2.

  * Fix possible client segfault when refusing to restore over existing files.
  * Make a failure to restore over a busy file not cause the whole restore to
    fail.
  * Print byte count as well as human readable byte count in the status summary
    screen.

    you need to upgrade your clients).
  * IPv6 patches.
  * Ability to specify the location of the client lockfiles on the server.
  * Make the server fork into the background by default. Use '-F' to stay in
    the foreground.

    IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF BURP:
    a) Your previous backups will no longer work, due to changes in the
    manifest files. You will also need to move old backups aside in order to
    continue to make new backups.
    b) Your old config files will need some fields to do with SSL added to them.
    See the man page and the examples in the 'configs' directory for help.

    IMPORTANT FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND THE FUTURE OF BURP:
    If you have tried burp, I really want to hear from you to find out what
    you like about it, what you don't like, what new features you would like,
    how you have been using it, whether it has helped you, or anything that
    you would like to tell me. I am currently working in the dark!

Changes in burp-1.0.31:
  * Large scale rewrites to the main backup process to make it more efficient
    and easier to understand.
  * Much tidying up of code and splitting into smaller files.
  * Removed complicated/flaky compression code from the network stuff. Network
    compression will come free with SSL anyway (when it is implemented).
    Currently, whole new files are transmitted compressed, file information
    and deltas are not.

Changes in burp-1.0.11:
  * Fixed Windows restore crash. Windows restores should now work better.

Changes in burp-1.0.10:
  * Fixed three major bugs introduced in burp-1.0.9 to do with client/server
    communication when doing deltas.
  * Make "make install" and the Windows installers not overwrite an existing
    config file.
  * Support for backup and restore of fifos and nodes.
  * KNOWN ISSUE: There seems to be a problem with restoring multiple files
    at once to Windows. I am working on this.

Changes in burp-1.0.9:
  * Added counters to summarise the files that were backed up or restored.
  * Added the ability to have warnings instead of errors always being fatal.
  * Prevent restores overwriting existing files, unless the new '-f' option is
    given.
  * Notice invalid characters in paths on Windows and replace them with
    '_'. This also means that you can now restore to alternative directories
    (the colon in the drive name no longer gets in the way).
  * Added instructions for building the Windows installer.
