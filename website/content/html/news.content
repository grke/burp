2014-04-09: OpenSSL Heartbleed bug
<BR>
It is being widely reported that some recent versions of openssl have a serious
bug. If your computers (especially your servers) are using a version of openssl
between 1.0.1 and 1.0.1f, you should upgrade them to openssl 1.0.1g as soon as
possible. Since this openssl bug has been around for 2 years, you should
probably consider your certificates to be compromised.
<BR>
<BR>
Burp windows clients were using openssl 1.0.1e. I understand that it
is a possibility that a malicious server could steal client information.
<BR>
I have therefore updated the Windows
<a href="/downloads/windows-build-tools/1.3.48/">burp-depkgs</a> with
openssl-1.0.1g and built updated Windows installers for burp-1.3.48
and burp-1.4.12. These installers can be found via the downloads page.
